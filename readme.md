A very basic Kirby CMS plugin to help website contributors maintain good accessibility habits when editing content.

You delivered a well designed, well developed website to your client with accessibility in mind? You may want to help your client and their team keep the website accessible.

This plugin helps them remember the main good accessibility habits when editing their content.

It does nothing except making it easier for you to add a panel tab with said good accessibility habits.
